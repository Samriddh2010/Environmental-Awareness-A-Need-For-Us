1.Chipko movement: nonviolent social and ecological movement by rural villagers, particularly women, in India in the 1970s, aimed at protecting
 trees and forests slated for government-backed logging. The movement originated in the Himalayan region of Uttarakhand (then part of Uttar 
 Pradesh) in 1973 and quickly spread throughout the Indian Himalayas. The Hindi word chipko means to hug or to cling to and reflects the 
 demonstrators primary tactic of embracing trees to impede loggers.

<p class="cause">2.Green revolution: great increase in production of food grains (especially wheat and rice) that resulted in large part from 
    the introduction into developingcountries of new, high-yielding varieties, beginning in the mid-20th century. Its early dramatic successes 
    were in Mexico and the Indian subcontinent. The new varieties require large amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to produce their 
    high yields, raising concerns about cost and potentially harmful environmental effects.

<p  class="cause">4.Silent Valley Movement: was a movement against the state to protect Silent valley, an evergreen tropical forest in the 
    Palakkad district of Kerala, India.  It was started in 1966 by an NGO led by Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) to save the Silent Valley from being flooded by a 
    hydroelectric project. In February 1973, the Planning Commission approved the project at a cost of about Rs. 25 crores. The valley was
