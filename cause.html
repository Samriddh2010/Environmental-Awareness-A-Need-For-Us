<h4 class="cause"><UL>Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through the depletion of natural resources, destruction of 
    ecosystems, and loss of biodiversity.
Major causes of environmental degradation are:-<br>
<li>Deforestation: Cutting down forests for wood, agriculture, and urban development reduces biodiversity, disrupts water cycles, and increases 
    carbon dioxide in the atmosphere further resulting in global warming.</li><br>
<li>Pollution: Air, water, and soil pollution from industrial activities, transportation, and improper waste disposal contaminates natural
 resources and harms living organisms.</li><br>

<li>Overpopulation: Rapid population growth increases the demand for resources, leading to overexploitation and disturb the balance of the 
environment.</li><br>


<li> Urbanization: Expansion of cities and infrastructure leads to habitat destruction, increased waste generation, and higher energy 
consumption.</li><br>
<li> Climate Change: Emission of greenhouse gases like methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide from human activities cause global warming,
 leading to extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and ecosystem disruptions.</li>

<h1 class="HEADING">EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION</h1>
<h4 class="cause"><ul><li>Ecosystem Imbalance: Disruption of natural processes and food chains can destabilize ecosystems, making them less resilient to 
    changes and external shocks.</li><br>
    <li>Soil Degradation: Erosion, deforestation, and industrial activities reduce soil fertility and productivity, affecting plant growth and 
    agriculture.</li><br>
    <li> Exposure to Toxins: Chemicals and hazardous waste can cause various health issues, including cancer, birth defects, and neurological 
    disorders.</li><br>
    <li>Loss of Livelihoods: Communities that depend on natural resources, such as fishing, farming, and tourism, may suffer economically from 
    degraded environments</li><br>
    <li> Displacement and Migration: Environmental degradation can force people to migrate due to loss of homes, livelihoods, or resources, leading
     to social conflicts and pressure on urban areas.</li><br>
     <li>Quality of Life: Reduced access to clean air, water, and natural spaces can negatively impact mental and physical well-being.</li><br>
     <li>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's surface observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere</li><br>
     <li>Ocean Acidification: Increased carbon dioxide levels lead to ocean acidification, which affects marine life and ecosystems, particularly 
    coral reefs and shellfis</li><br></ul></h4>
